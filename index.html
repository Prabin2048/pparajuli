            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum information sciences and condensed matter physics. I am 
                originally from Nepal. I have completed a Master's degree in physics from the Tribhuvan University, Nepal in 2016. After that, I came to the University 
                of California, Merced to persue Ph.D. degree in Physics. I have completed my Ph.D. degree in May 2022. From 
                June 2022 to September 2023, I worked at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as a Postdoctoral researcher.
                Since Dec 2023 I have been working at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville as a Postdoctoral researcher.

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research interest lies in the intersection of quantum manybody physics, quantum information sciencs
                and atomic, molecular and optical physics. In my doctoral study, I had worked on projects related to
                quantum many-body state preparation. I had developed 3 different techniques for a fast and efficient  
                many body state preparation in Jaynes-Cummings lattices whcih are based on nonlinear optical ramping method,
                shortcuts to adiabaticity method, and quantum optimal control method. In my first postdoctoral tenure, I 
                had worked on novel color center qubit synthesis project, and quantum sensing project. Now, I am working on
                quantum spin liquid project. Our essential goal is to realize quantum spin liquid phase of 4-He in 1d geometry.
